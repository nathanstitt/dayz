## A day/week/monthly calendar component for React

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nathanstitt/dayz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nathanstitt/dayz)

## Features
* Only includes the minimal amount of features needed.
    * There is no paging controls provided, as they can easily be implemented outside the component.  This allows Dayz to be used both as a traditional next or previous month calendar or as part of a scrolling infinite view.
* Modern styling and layout
    * Uses css grid and flexbox layout
    * All heights/widths are specified as percentages so the component will size to fit whatever container it's rendered into.
    * Styles are written in [scss](dayz.scss) with variables which can be modified for customized builds.
* Care is taken to retain elements when switching view types, this allows minimal DOM reflow and allows nice animation effects where events warp into position.

## Demo

An interactive demo can be viewed at: http://nathanstitt.github.io/dayz/

The demo source for the demo is [demo.jsx](demo.jsx)

## Usage

```bash
npm install dayz --save
-- or --
yarn add dayz
```

```js
import React from 'react';
import Dayz from 'dayz';
// could also import the sass if you have a loader at dayz/dayz.scss
import "dayz/dist/dayz.css";
import moment from 'moment';

// would come from a network request in a "real" app
const EVENTS = new Dayz.EventsCollection([
    { content: 'A short event',
      range: moment.range( date.clone(),
                           date.clone().add(1, 'day') ) },
    { content: 'Two Hours ~ 8-10',
      range: moment.range( date.clone().hour(8),
                           date.clone().hour(10) ) },
    { content: "A Longer Event",
      range: moment.range( date.clone().subtract(2,'days'),
                           date.clone().add(8,'days') ) }
]);

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

    render() {
        return <Dayz
                   display='week'
                   date={this.props.date}
                   events={EVENTS}
               />
    }

}
```

## API

The Dayz component accepts these properties:

 * **date** (required):     An `momentjs` instance that controls what range is displayed. The calendar will automatically calculate the month or week that contains this date and display the appropriate range.
 * **events** (optional):  An `Dayz.EventsCollection` instance that contains events that should be displayed on the calendar.
   * `Dayz.EventsCollection` accepts two arguments:
     * An array of events
     * a list of optional properties. Currently two options that can be set are:
       * **displayAllDay**, If set to `true` it will show events that are marked as an all day event at the top of the week and day views prior to showing other events.  If `false`, events marked as an all day event will completely fill the column for the day, with other events appearing on top of it.  defaults to `true`.  Please note: Although sometimes useful, if set to false it can create a very cluttered calendar.
       * **displayLabelForAllDays**, If set to `false`, for events that are shown on multiple days only the first event will have the `content` attribute shown. In any other case `content` will be shown on every day. This prop works only if `displayAllDay` is `false`.
 * **highlightDays**:  either a function or an array of days that should be highlighted.  Each day can be a string date that momentjs accepts, a JS Date object, or a momentjs date.  if using a function, it will be passed the day and should return either false, or a string to use for the className.
 * **dayEventHandlers** event handlers to attach on the Day element, such as onClick, onMouseOver, etc.
   * if **onClick** or **onDoubleClick** is given to dayEventHandlers, the call back will be passed two variables, the event and a `momentjs` date.  Hours/Minutes are added to the date to reflect how far down the Y axis was clicked.
 * **display** (optional, defaults to 'month'):  One of month, week, or day.
 * **onEventClick**, **onEventDoubleClick** (optional): A function that will be called whenever an event is clicked, it's passed two variables, the event and the layout information for the event.  The layout has an `event` subkey that includes the event itself.
 * **displayHours** (optional): defaults to 7am to 7pm or the earliest/latest event's hour.
 * **timeFormat** (optional): defaults to `ha` configures y labels time format
 * **locale** (optional): defaults to `en`. A string to determine the localization.
 * **weekStartsOn** (optional): defaults to `undefined`. Determines whether the week should start on Monday or Sunday. By default it uses what the localization offers (see `locale` prop). It can accept either `0` to start the week on Sunday or `1` to start the week on Monday.

Dayz applies these css classes:
 * The reference **date** prop will have a css class "current"
 * Days before and after that date will get "before" and "after" respectively
 * highlighted days will be marked as "highlight" by default, or whatever is returned from the function


### Development

- `npm start` starts up a local development web-server which rebuilds files when changed
   - the demo can then be accessed at http://localhost:2222/docs/ 
- `npm test` runs unit tests
- `npm run build` compiles files in preparation for publishing
